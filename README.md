SmartExtractor
==============

SmartExtractor extracts archives so that a wrapping folder is only created when the content consists of more than one file/folder.
It uses Python 3 and 7-Zip.


In order to use it, the following points are necessary:

- You should have installed Python 3 and 7-Zip.
- 7-Zip should be in your PATH.
- Use the bat-file to associate archive types (like .zip, .rar, .7z etc) with SmartExtractor.
